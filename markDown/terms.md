## 13. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

## 14. Dispute Resolution & Binding Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY — IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.**

**Informal Resolution.** Before initiating any formal dispute resolution process, you agree to first contact us at [INSERT EMAIL] to attempt to resolve any dispute informally. We will attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith within 60 days of your notice.

**Agreement to Arbitrate.** If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms, Kracked, or your use of Kracked (collectively, "Disputes") by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by these Terms.

**Arbitration Procedures.**
- The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator;
- The arbitration will be conducted in English;
- The arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside or in California, at your option;
- The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding;
- Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

**Class Action Waiver.** YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. If a court determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void, but the remainder of these Terms will remain in effect.

**Exceptions to Arbitration.** The following claims are not subject to arbitration:
- Claims for injunctive or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement or misuse;
- Claims that may be brought in small claims court;
- Claims that cannot be arbitrated as a matter of law.

**Opt-Out Right.** You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by sending us written notice at [INSERT EMAIL] stating your name, account information, and clear intent to opt out of arbitration. If you opt out, disputes will be resolved in court as set forth in Section 13.

**Waiver of Jury Trial.** IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER than IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

(c) display a prominent notice the next time you open or foreground Kracked on the day the changes take effect;

We may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction, including to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.

**Waiver.** Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such provision or any other provision. No waiver will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative.

**Entire Agreement.** These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and any Community Guidelines, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of Kracked and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, or communications.

**Notices.** We may provide notices to you by:
- In-app notification;
- Email to the address associated with your account;

**California Residents.** If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."
